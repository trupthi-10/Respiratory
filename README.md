This project presents a multimodal AI-based lung disease detection system that integrates physiological parameters such as heart rate, SpO₂ and blood pressure with chest X-ray analysis. Vitals data is used to assess lung health risk, while deep learning models analyze chest X-rays to accurately detect and classify the presence of lung diseases.
